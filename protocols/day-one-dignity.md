# Day One Dignity — Summit Framework & Protocol

## Purpose
Seed a national listening summit and a set of local pilot protocols that prioritize due process, representation, and restorative practices.

## Opening remarks (seed)
> "I didn't come here to point fingers or pretend I have all the answers. I came because too many people feel this system isn't about justice—it's about control. Tell me straight: what's working? what's broken? what can we do, together, to make this feel fair again?"

## Summit invitee categories
- Judges and court administrators  
- Prosecutors and public defenders  
- Formerly incarcerated people and family members  
- Victims' advocates and restorative justice practitioners  
- Law enforcement leadership and frontline officers  
- Civil rights and community organizations  
- Health, housing, and social services providers

## Listening framework
1. **Ground rules:** confidentiality, respect, and lived-experience priority.  
2. **Prompt 1:** Where does the system most often fail people? (concrete examples)  
3. **Prompt 2:** What local practices have reduced harm or rebuilt trust? (evidence)  
4. **Prompt 3:** What immediate policy changes would reduce coercion and increase fairness?

## Seeded policy priority: Due Process Restoration
- **Goal:** universal access to counsel and reduced plea coercion.  
- **Initial actions:**  
  - Fund public defender offices to reduce caseloads.  
  - Pilot early legal screening at arrest and pre-charge diversion.  
  - Create a national toolkit for plea transparency and informed consent.
