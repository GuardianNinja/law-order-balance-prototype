# Day One Dignity — Law & Order Balance Prototype

**Short description**  
A community-driven, open-source prototype for reimagining justice: a practical, humane set of protocols, summit frameworks, and policy drafts designed to rebuild trust, restore due process, and center rehabilitation and restoration.

---

## Vision
This repo is a public, collaborative space to design, test, and iterate on concrete policy prototypes and community protocols that can be adapted locally and scaled nationally. We treat policy like software: versioned, auditable, and open to contribution.

---

## Quick start
1. Read the **protocols/** folder to see seeded drafts.
2. Open an issue for a new idea or to request research.
3. Pick a `good first issue` and submit a PR following `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Goals
- **Restore due process** by expanding legal representation and reducing coercive plea pressure.  
- **Reduce harm** by prioritizing alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenses.  
- **Rebuild trust** through listening summits and community-led oversight.  
- **Open-source policy** so communities can adapt, test, and iterate.
