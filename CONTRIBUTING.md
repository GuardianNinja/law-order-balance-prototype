## Who can contribute
Everyone. Lived experience, legal practitioners, researchers, community organizers, and writers are all welcome. Be respectful and constructive.

---

## Ways to contribute
- **Docs & drafts:** Improve `protocols/*.md` or add evidence and citations.  
- **Research:** Add references, data, and summaries.  
- **Community:** Help moderate discussions and triage issues.  
- **Outreach:** Translate content or adapt for local contexts.  
- **Technical:** Add tooling, templates, or automation for maintainers.

---

## Workflow
1. **Fork** the repo.  
2. **Create a branch** from `main` named `topic/short-description` (e.g., `protocols/bail-reform-summary`).  
3. Make focused commits with clear messages (imperative tense).  
4. Open a **Pull Request** against `main` and link the issue (if any).  
5. Request reviewers and follow the PR checklist below.

---

## Branch naming and commit style
- Branch: `area/short-description` (e.g., `protocols/day-one-dignity`).  
- Commit messages: `type(scope): short summary` (e.g., `docs(protocols): add bail reform evidence bullets`).

---

## Pull Request checklist
Before requesting review, ensure:
- [ ] PR has a short summary and motivation.
- [ ] Linked issue or explanation of why this change is needed.
- [ ] All TODOs in the file are addressed or left intentionally with `<!-- TODO: ... -->`.
- [ ] No PII or secrets included.
- [ ] If applicable, add reviewer suggestions (names or teams).
- [ ] If the change affects policy language, include at least one supporting source or rationale.

---

## Issue guidelines
When opening an issue, include:
- **Title:** short, descriptive.  
- **Problem statement:** what is broken or missing.  
- **Proposed solution:** brief sketch or ask for help.  
- **References:** links, data, or lived-experience notes.  
- **Urgency / scope:** local pilot, national, research-only.

Use the provided issue templates for `proposal` or `research`.

---

## Labels & triage
We use labels like `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `proposal`, `research`, `policy-draft`, and `needs-review`. Maintainers will triage new issues within a few business days.

---

## Mentorship & pairing
If you want pairing or mentorship, add the `mentorship-request` label and tag a maintainer in the issue. We try to match new contributors with a mentor for the first PR.

---

## Security & sensitive data
Do not include personal data, legal documents with identifying info, or secrets. To report a security or privacy issue, open an issue with the `security` label and mark it private, or contact a maintainer directly (see `MAINTAINERS` section below).

---

## Code of Conduct & License
By contributing you agree to follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. This project is licensed under the MIT License (`LICENSE`).

## Maintainers / Contact
- **Maintainer team:** listed in `MAINTAINERS.md` (or add a maintainer section here).  
- Response time: maintainers aim to respond to issues and PRs within 5 business days.
